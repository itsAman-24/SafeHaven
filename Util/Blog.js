      title: "Why I Built SafeHaven: A Mission for Peace and Protection",
      excerpt: "The story behind SafeHaven — a personal initiative to help Indian citizens stay safe during growing tensions.",
      content: `
        In light of the ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan, I built SafeHaven with the aim of helping fellow Indian citizens find verified safe zones quickly and easily.
  
        As a developer, I felt the urge to use technology not just to build apps, but to build hope. SafeHaven is still in its early stages, but the mission is clear: provide trustworthy, accessible, and timely safety data to those who need it most.
  
        I believe that during times of national crisis, a platform like this can make a real difference — by connecting people with safe locations, alert systems, and community support.

      title: "How to Identify a Safe Zone During National Emergencies",
      excerpt: "Learn the basics of spotting and verifying safe zones when you're in an emergency situation.",
      content: `
        In conflict zones or national emergencies, knowing where to go can be lifesaving. Here are some tips to help:
  
        1. Look for government-designated shelters.
        2. Follow verified emergency channels or apps like SafeHaven.
        3. Stay away from border areas, military zones, and high-risk public locations.
        4. Connect with local community volunteers or groups for guidance.
        5. Use offline maps and alerts when internet connectivity is unreliable.
  
        Safe zones aren't just about physical safety; they're about access to water, electricity, communication, and support. Always stay informed, and have a backup plan ready.
